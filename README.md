# The Impact of Referee Decisions on Football Match Outcomes

## Overview
This project explores the influence of football referees on match outcomes in the English Premier League (EPL). The focus is on analyzing the decisions made by referees, including the issuance of fouls, yellow cards, and red cards, and examining how these decisions correlate with match results from the 2014-2015 to 2018-2019 seasons. This project highlights the importance of referee decisions in football and their potential to influence match outcomes. The findings underscore the need for fair and unbiased officiating in sports to ensure the integrity of the game. The results can inform discussions about improving referee training and evaluation processes to minimize biases and enhance the fairness of competitions.

## Objective
The primary goal is to identify potential biases among referees and assess their impact on game outcomes. The project aims to answer three key questions:
1. Is there a difference in the number of fouls, yellow cards, and red cards given to the "Big 6" teams (Manchester United, Liverpool FC, Arsenal FC, Chelsea FC, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur) compared to other teams?
2. Which referees display biases towards certain teams?
3. Which teams are most likely to receive fouls, yellow cards, and red cards?

## Tools
The analysis was conducted using the R programming language, leveraging various statistical and data visualization tools.

## Data
The dataset comprises match results, player statistics, and referee performance data from the EPL, focusing on games officiated by referees who presided over at least 20 matches during the five seasons.
