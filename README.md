# The Impact of Referee Decisions on Football Match Outcomes

## Description
Football referees play a pivotal role in shaping match outcomes through their decisions on fouls, penalties, and cards. The project investigates potential biases among English Premier League referees, sparked by controversial incidents during the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Analyzing comprehensive data from the 2014-2015 to 2018-2019 seasons, we aim to address key questions:

1. Are there disparities in the frequency of fouls, yellow cards, and red cards issued to the Big 6 teams (Manchester United, Liverpool FC, Arsenal FC, Chelsea FC, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur) compared to others?

2. Which referees exhibit discernible biases towards specific teams?

3. Which teams are most frequently penalized with fouls, yellow cards, and red cards?

Our project holds significant implications for understanding fairness in football officiating and illuminating potential areas for improvement in referee training and oversight. By uncovering patterns and insights, we strive to contribute to a more transparent and equitable sporting environment.
